"""Helpers shared by the OGX -> Praxis migration tests.

The Gateway helpers resolve what actually serves an API path from the cluster
itself: a path is matched against the HTTPRoutes that declare it, and from a
matching route the backend Services and their pods are resolved. Nothing about
Praxis naming is hardcoded, so a route pointing at the wrong backend cannot pass
unnoticed.
